# VideoSP500
This is a second attempt at the Rmarkdown and the SP 500 time series data.  I had gotten out of synch on video lessons and did not watch the time
series set.  Now the homework makes more sense and I don't feel quite so lost with the Rmarkdown file. 
So this is the video lecture submission of the SP 500 time series lesson.

Just Knitr the Create.Rmd file and you will get a Create.html with the code and plots.
